// StateKey is an opaque identifier for a set of LocalBackend state
// (preferences, private keys, etc.).
//
// The reason we need this is that the Tailscale agent may be running
// on a multi-user machine, in a context where a single daemon is
// shared by several consecutive users. Ideally we would just use the
// username of the connected frontend as the StateKey.
//
// However, on Windows, there seems to be no safe way to figure out
// the owning user of a process connected over IPC mechanisms
// (sockets, named pipes). So instead, on Windows, we use a
// capability-oriented system where the frontend generates a random
// identifier for itself, and uses that as the StateKey when talking
// to the backend. That way, while we can't identify an OS user by
// name, we can tell two different users apart, because they'll have
// different opaque state keys (and no access to each others's keys).
//
// It would be much nicer if we could just figure out the OS user that
// owns the connected frontend, but here we are.
